# sudoku
My first attempt to apply backtracking to solve sudoku with references.

I have watched some Youtube videos about backtracking and its application to solve a sudoku puzzle.

References: Youtube
1) Tech with Tim - Sudoku with backtracking
2) Computerphile - Sudoku 

I got the code to print the sudoku board from video 1.

Video 2 gave a clear explanation on the algorithm.

Please note that I did not code as I watch the videos. Instead, I watched and understand the videos first then I code without reference as I believe this is an effective learning method.

Please feel free to look through, edit and comment on the code :-)
